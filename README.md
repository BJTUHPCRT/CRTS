# Abstract
High energy consumption in cloud computing poses a huge challenge on reasonable and efficient task scheduling. However, current solutions have mostly focused on the allocation of tasks to suitable hosts and neglected the significant effect of the relationship between tasks on scheduling outcomes, which supplies us with a kind of new perspective. In this paper, a novel Complementary Relationship(CR) is proposed to dig out potential relationship hiding between tasks, and a Complementary Relationship-based approach, named CRTS, is proposed for energy-aware task scheduling in cloud computing. In our CRTS method, complementary relationship is first extracted by computing minimum variance for all user requests. Moreover, those tasks with complementary relationship will be integrated into an encoder-decoder prediction model with an attention module to predict the future system workload. The final task scheduling, completed based on the predicted workload, enables proactive scheduling of tasks with complementary relationship to the same server, so as to improve resource utilization and achieve energy saving in cloud computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CRTS approach is very effective in optimizing resource utilization and reducing energy consumption while maintaining high performance by considering the specific complementary relationship.
